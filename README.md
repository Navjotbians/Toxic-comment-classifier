# Toxic Comment Classifier

It is been evident that human psychology is changing; our emotions are getting attached with the likes, comments and tags we receive on the social media. We receive both good and bad comment but the impact of toxic comments is affecting the engagement of the users in the meaningful conversations.
Moreover, users can see others using hateful words, slurs and ideas, and those things are becoming normal but the severity and viciousness of these comments has evolved into something much more sinister such as recent capitol riots at US parliament and attack on farmers by local goons in India.

## Motivation
Sharp increase in hateful comments on the farmers who are protesting at the outskirts of India's capital Delhi since October 2020 against the 3 Farm Bills that has been passed by the government in September 2020. Due to rampant toxicity, people are avoiding having meaningful discussion on these bills. Therefore, having a solid toxicity flagging system in place will allow online forums and social media platforms to effectively facilitate conversations.

## Goal 
To build a Multi- label Classification model capable of detecting different level of toxicity like severe toxic, threats, obscenity, insults, and so on.
