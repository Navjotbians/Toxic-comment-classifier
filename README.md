# Toxic Comment Classifier



It is been evident that human psychology is changing, our emotions are getting attached with the likes, comments and tags we receive on the social media.
We receive both good and bad comment but the impact of toxic comments is affecting the engagement of the users in the meaningful conversations.
Moreover, users can see others using hateful words, slurs and ideas, and those things are becoming normal but the severity and viciousness of these comments 
has evolved into something much more sinister such as recent capitol roits at US parliment and attack on farmers by local goons in India.

Motivation
-Sharp increase in hateful comments on farmers who are protesting at the outskirts of India's capital Delhi since october 2020 against the 3 Farm bills that has been passed by the government
in september 2020. Due to rampant toxicity, people are avoiding having meaningful discussion on these bills. 
Therefore, having a solid toxicity flagging system in place will allow online platforms to effectively facilitate conversations.

Goal 
To buils a model capable of detecting different level of toxicity like severe toxic, threats, obscenity, insults, and so on. 

Multi- label Classification 

Problem defination - build a model to detect the different level of toxicity for each comment.
